# About Me

I'm **Animesh Sharma** - The Lead Vocalist and Guitarist of **The Bermuda Triangle Band**

> Welcome to my world of colors, emotions, and imagination. I am an artist driven by the desire to tell stories through paint, texture, and light. 
    
    > My work explores a range of themes — from the calm of nature and the power of motion to the depth of human expression and the beauty of imagination. Each piece I create is a reflection of a moment, a feeling, or an idea that words often cannot express. I experiment with different mediums and styles — from vibrant acrylic landscapes to detailed graphite sketches — allowing every artwork to find its own unique voice.
        
        > Art, to me, is not just a form of creation but a journey of discovery — of self, of the world, and of the emotions that connect us all. Through my work, I hope to evoke curiosity, inspire reflection, and spark a sense of wonder in those who experience it. 
            
            > Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I invite you to see, feel, and interpret each piece in your own way — because art truly comes alive in the eyes of the beholder.
